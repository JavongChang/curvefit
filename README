curvefit - a command line Levenberg-Marquardt solver for ic50 and
Michaelis-Menten data.

The ic50 model is based on the equation:

y = 1 - (delta / (1 + (ic50 / x)^hill))

The Michaelis-Menten model is based on the equation:

y = Vmax * x / (Km + x)

The program finds values for delta, ic50, and hill or Vmax, and Km
that minimizes the difference between input and fitted values.

Requirements: GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

A very basic makefile is included.

The command to run the program is

./curvefit -f /path/to/input/data -m <model> [-x <float> -y <float> -z <float>]

Required Arguments:

-f      Path to input data. Must be a tab delimited text file of (x, y) value 
        pairs. No other data should be included in the file.

-m      Desired model. Valid options are ic50 and mm.

Optional Arguments:

-xyz    Specify initial values for the parameters to fit. Default values are
        1.0.

        flag    ic50    mm

TODO:
1. Add more models
2. Expand input options
